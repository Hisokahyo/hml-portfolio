<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Im a 2 year course programming graduate way back 2011.When I was in college I do not have my own laptop,
  I have to borrow it from my classmate. And you know how difficult it was, luckily we we're able to graduate with honors.

</p>

<p>When I graduated I tried applying, however most of the companies required with experience. I tried couple of companies and show them my portfolio before but no luck.
  That's when I lost confidence about my skills. In order for me to succeed in life I have to go to a different path. I did not pursue my dream job and just focus on earning money. That's how difficult 
to land a job here in the Philippines without experience.</p>

<p>After how many years working in a BPO, I was able to save money to buy my first very own laptop. It's an achievement and that's where I decided to relearn and go back to my first love.
  Which is coding, every time I saw something in the website, I always inspect it however I am no longer familiar with some of the codes. That's where I decided to enroll in Udemy to refresh and start again. I hope with this platform
  I could soon land into my dream job and passion. Would love to see everyones porfolio too :)
